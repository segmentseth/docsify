<div style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; font-weight: 200;"><p>This document provides a technical summary of [Customer Name]’s instrumented applications with Segment, including both the client-facing user experience, and the backend API systems. It is meant to be used in tandem with [Customer Name]’s Tracking Plan as a resource for [Customer Name] team members that documents the implementation work we have done together, so it can be referenced in the future. </p>
